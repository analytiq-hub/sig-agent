The [Smart Document Router](https://docrouter.ai) is an open source Document Understanding and Data Extraction tool. It is like [LLamaCloud](https://docs.llamaindex.ai), but for Enterprises using ERP systems.
* It ingests unstructured docs from faxes, email, and ERPs.
* It selects streams of docs that can be processed autonomously with LLMs and NLP - reducing the need for time-consuming, expensive manual workflows.

The Document Router is designed to work with a human-in-the-loop and can processes financial data correctly 'on the nose'. (We are not doing RAG!)
